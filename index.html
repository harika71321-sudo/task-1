    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech student passionate about technology, design, and problem-solving.  
I enjoy building web applications and exploring UI/UX design principles to create user-friendly digital experiences.  

Currently, I'm developing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and experimenting with responsive layouts to make websites look great on all devices.  
Beyond coding, I’m curious about how design impacts usability and love refining details to match professional standards.  
My goal is to continue learning and growing as a developer while creating meaningful digital experiences that users love.
